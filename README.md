# Python-Remove-Duplicate-Files

This is a very simple script that detects, and optionally removes, duplicate files in a given directory. Written for Python 3.6.

I am using this as a learning opporunity to familiarize myself with Python.

## Usage
```
python3.6 scan.py /path/to/scan/
python3.6 scan.py /path/to/scan/ --delete
```
